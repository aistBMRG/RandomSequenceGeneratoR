# RandomSequenceGeneratoR
This repository describes a R workflow for the generation of random DNA sequences, based on the approach described in Tourlousse et al. (2017).

**Approach:**
The process for generating the sequences starts from a set of random k-mers that are subsequently concatenated into longer sequences and screened based on user-defined conditions, namely homopolymers, GC content, repeats, palindromes and between-sequence identity.
